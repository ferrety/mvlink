# mvlink

A Qt application that allows you to drag and drop files to move them to another directory while creating symbolic links from the new location back to the original location.

## How to Use

1. Drag and drop files from your file manager into the application window
2. Click "Browse..." to select a destination directory
3. Click "Move Files & Create Symlinks" to move the files and create symbolic links
4. The status at the bottom of the window will show the result of the operation


## Building and running with Docker
Note when running the application using docker it has access only files accessible in the docker image.
It's possible to use executable generated by the docker compose to access host's files.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose (optional)
- X11 server running on host (for Linux GUI applications)

#### Running with Docker

1. Build the image

```bash
docker build -t mvlink .
```

2. Launch the app
```bash
xhost +local:docker && docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix mvlink ; xhost -local:docker
```

#### Building the Application

1. Build the application without launching it
```bash
docker compose up build
```

#### Running with docker compose

1. Allow X server connections:
```bash
xhost +local:docker
```

2. Build and run the application:
```bash
docker compose run launch
```

3. After using the application, you can revoke X server access:
```bash
xhost -local:docker
```

#### Running make

1. Run a specific make target, e.g, clean:
```bash
MAKE_TARGET=clean docker compose run make
```

### Running Tests with Docker Compose

1. Build and run the tests:
```bash
docker compose run test
```
